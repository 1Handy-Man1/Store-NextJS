    "desc": "The original Pokémon is a role-playing game based around building a small team of monsters to battle other monsters in a quest to become the best. Pokémon are divided into types, such as water and fire, each with different strengths. Battles between them can be likened to the simple hand game rock-paper-scissors.",
    "history": "Pokémon was invented by a Japanese man named Satoshi Tajiri and his friend Ken Sugimori, who is an illustrator. Back in 1982 Satoshi started a gaming magazine together with his friends called Game Freak, but after a while he decided to start making his own video games, instead of writing about them.",

    "rule": "Each player may have only one Active Pokémon at a time. If your opponent doesn't have any more Pokémon in play, you win the game! If a Pokémon is affected by a Special Condition, it will be cured if that Pokémon moves to the Bench or evolves. While Asleep, a Pokémon cannot attack or retreat."
